Clickly Game

In this application users can play a game where they can not click the same photo more then once. With users trying to beat the high score.

This application is missing two parts.

The mixing of the cards and the linking to the counter.

The application renders different images on the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

Then the application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Making them lose the game.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. "In the works"

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

This application is not finished. Due to unseen circumstances.
